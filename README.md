# Win32XmlUI
A UI framework for C++ and Windows for Windows XP+

## Usage
This project supports both static and dynamic linking; see the sample folder

## Building
You will need:
* [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/)
* Any copy of the [Windows SDK](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2317808) that has mt.exe (note that `build_sample.bat` is targeted to `10.0.26100.0` - you'll need to change that if you downloaded something else)

From there, just run `build.bat`. To build the sample, run `build_sample.bat` in the `sample` folder.
